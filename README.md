## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Our team brainstormed questions for the survey which was really fun. We then decided on how to add value to the radio button inputs that would return the names. The inputs are essentially "shuffled" to support the various combinations the user can choose to get their answer. Conditional statements were made to compare the combinations and produce a name.

## Lessons Learned:

Some important takeaways from working on this series was learning how to extract values from radio button-style inputs.
